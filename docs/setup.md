# OptiWrite AI Python .exe - Setup

This document provides instructions on how to set up the OptiWrite AI Python .exe project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/optiwrite-ai-python-exe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd optiwrite-ai-python-exe
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the OptiWrite AI Python .exe application, follow these steps:

1. Modify the AI models and optimization scripts in the `models` directory to suit your needs.

2. Customize the GUI in the `gui` directory to enhance the user interface.

3. Test the application by running the Python scripts:

   ```bash
   python src/optiwrite_ai.py
   ```

4. Once you are satisfied with the application, create a standalone .exe executable using PyInstaller:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile src/optiwrite_ai.py
   ```

   This will generate an executable file in the `dist` directory.

5. Distribute the executable file to users who can benefit from the OptiWrite AI tool.
